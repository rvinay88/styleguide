##Generic Rules##

* Image proportion maintained at 640x960px 
* No white space above and below the model (No shoe reflections)
* Align all images to center of the grid 
* Zoom level to be maintained in all the images

##Medium to full size images
Items such as rain coats are usually longer than torso level

* The image needs to be cut exactly where the product ends
* Leave a little room for bleed above and below

##Torso Images 
For shirts, blouses and items covering top half of the body

Torso images are cut midway near the end of fully stretched hands of the model. This remains the same even if the top is really small. We use this to standardize all images of the torso 

##Bottom Images

Includes skirts, shorts, pants and all dressing items for the lower half

* Cut the image a little above the beginning of the clothing
* Retain the full length of the leg and the shoes 

##Product Images 
Images of products are usually maintained at a higher zoom level. The product image should look bigger in size than an image of a model wearing the product

* Fit the image to the 640x960px grid 
* Very little white space above and below the product 

##Grid 
The grid should look as below
* Product should be visible fully
* All product images look similar 
* All images with models look similar 
* All similar images have the same amount of zoom, white space and size.
